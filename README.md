# SlimeVR Compact Case by Twidge

A compact case for SlimeVR trackers using:
- D1 Mini ESP microcontroller
- BNO08X IMU
- TP4056 USB-C charging module
- 503450 1000mAh lithium ion cell
- 7mm x 3mm x 8.3mm panel switch

I recommend printing the tray with support material to keep it dimensionally accurate as it's sized exactly for this battery, you can use a minimal support infill however.

Support should not be necessary for the other parts.

Lids should be printed flipped over with the 'top' side against the build plate.

If you print the diffuser in white or a semi-translucent material you can see the battery charge LEDs while charging, however with this design the ESP is 'upside down' and the status LED is not visible.  This part is meant to be glued behind the SlimeVR logo in the lid, and may need some trimming to fit the shallow insert space depending on your printer.
